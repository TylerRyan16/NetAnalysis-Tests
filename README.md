# Description
This is a test file for Dr. Farnan's Project 4 (Graphs). It is more robust than the tests provided and aims to help every user get the best grade possible on the project. 

There are 5 files:
- NetAnalysisTests.java  <-- main file
- test_data.txt          <-- main data input file
- copper_only_data.tx    <-- data file with copper only connections
- strong_data.txt        <-- data file that survives 2 failed vertexes
- small_data.txt         <-- data file with 2 vertexes, 1 edge
- unconnected_data.txt   <-- data file with graph that has unconnected sections
